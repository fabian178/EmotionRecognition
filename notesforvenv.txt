This is what you should do if you don't want to create a new virtual environment:

In venv/bin folder there are 3 files that store your venv path explicitly and if the path is wrong they take the normal python path so you should change the path there to your new path.

change: set -gx VIRTUAL_ENV "what/ever/path/you/need"  in activate.fish

change: VIRTUAL_ENV="what/ever/path/you/need" in activate

change: setenv VIRTUAL_ENV "what/ever/path/you/need" in activate.csh

Note #1:
the path is to /venv and not to /venv/bin
